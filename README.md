## bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! bookbot

### Output the Character and Occurences through CLI. 

#### Simply run main.py <file location> of a book in .txt format and get the output:
- File location
- Total word count
- Character Count

This was my first program using Neovim, no vscode on this project!
